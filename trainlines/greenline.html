                Yay Medford/Tufts Station :D
                End of the geen line extension. Pretty average, nice looking station. It’s clean and nice and open. Has a bicycle cage as well. This is good. I like this.

                Aria’s MBTA Station Review!
                Yay Ball Square Station :D
                Green line extension. Pretty average, nice looking station. I feel like a lot of the green line extension stops look the same so it's pretty average. It’s clean and nice and open. Has a bicycle cage as well.

                Aria’s MBTA Station Review!
                Underground Green and Blue line transfer station. I really like the glass entrance, I think it’s pretty cool. Bigger station and relatively clean I guess. Lot more open compared to the other stations. Extremely loud green line though like omg this is one of the loudest stations.

                Underground Green and Red line transfer station. Red line all trains, green line separate entrances. Not a bad station as I expected. Relatively clean and nice and open.

                Yay Boylston Station :D
                Underground Green line station. I like the entrances to the station, I think they’re cool. Basically built like two big boxes but it’s more interesting than most of them. The lines are in different entrances so don’t go in the wrong one. I feel like the station is so loud. It’s the MBTA they’re all loud but idk maybe it’s just me.

                Underground Green line station. Honestly pretty boring. It’s one of the stations and that’s about it.

                Yay Copley Station :D
                Underground Green line stop. I like the glass entrances to the station and the one connected to the library. Pretty similar to prudential and symphony except it has all Green Line connections.

                Underground E line stop connected to the mall but otherwise is not really interesting. All trains on one stop. Kinda dirty as well but that’s like standard MBTA.

                Underground E line stop. Not the most interesting and it's kinda dirty but at least it’s better than Boylston. Has two different entrances for each way so make sure not to take the wrong one

                It’s a station and that’s about it. No timers either so you’ll have to look up the train eta. I can usually board for free though so that’s cool
